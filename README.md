# Malware Analysis Final Project
Static Analysis Tool
Khoa Do, Scott Hunt, Casey Schablein, Noah Trenaman


## Setup
Assuming the project is currently in a zip folder
1. Unzip / Extract to a location of your choosing. You should see two folders called `examples`, `function_tables` and two .py files called `static_analyzers.py` and `main.py`
    -`static_analyzers.py` contains the functions that the main program will use for static analysis
    -`main.py` is the main program, handling CLI, directory creation and converting functions to byte code
    -`examples` is the folder containing the .py files that has the functions we want to disassemble. We have supplied some files for easy testing.
    -`function_tables` is the folder containing the disassembled information of a function. This is dynamically created by the program but has been supplied ahead of time for easy testing.
2. Execute!

## Executing the Program

1. Open the terminal
2. CD into the folder containing `main.py` 
3. Execute `main.py` using the `python` command

##### Options 
- `-U` : This option is for checking if a function has any unused variables on the stack
- `-C` : This option is gathering all the constants in a function
- `-R` : This option is for checking if a function is recursive, returns the name if so

Example:

Running this command...
```shell
PS C:\Users\user1\Malware-Final-Project> python main.py -U "unused_sum_function"     
```
...will output this
```shell
Checking for any unused variables on the stack...
Unused variable(s) found:
['unused', 'unused2', 'unused3']    
```
