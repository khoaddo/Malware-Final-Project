**Find variables that are never accessed**
Somehow look at the instructions to verify if a variable is ever read from the stack.

**Find anomalous constants**
Like passwords or API keys
Can do the same thing with function calls and imports -- make sure none are unexpected for security reasons.

**Find branches that can never be accessed**

**Find conditionals (booleans) that never vary**

**Highlight signs of recursion**
